# HeathenBot
Bot for #Asatru and #Pagan
One part joke, one part actually useful.
There is a Trello board at https://trello.com/b/FFaxZmlt/heathenbot.
You can add feature requests or bugs to the "To-Do" column.
I'll probably set up a FogBugz at some point for bug tracking, maybe.
If your request has been moved to the "Denied Requests" column, I will not work the feature, but other devs are free to do so.
If you move something from the Do Not Work column, please move it directly to In Progress.
